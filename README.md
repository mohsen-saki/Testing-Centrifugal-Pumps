# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT INSPECTION & TESTING of CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS

The spreadsheet here is to analyse collected test data and verify a centrifugal pump performance against design stage specifications.

1. It has been prepared to be a __`GUIDE BOOK`__ and __`REPORT SHEET`__ at the same time.

2. Almost every remark there comes from relevant international standards unless some helping information (like glossaries) which is general information available on the net.

3. It has been assumed that __`API 610`__ is main reference for tests & inspections. However, other major standardsâ€™ requirements (HI & ISO) are also reported and the excel sheet is quite adaptable. For sure this brings up a good chance to compare major standards against each other to see how they suits different purchaser needs.

4. Calculations regarding __`PERFORMANCE`__, ___`NPSH`_, and __`VISCOSITY CORRECTION`__ are only for METRIC (SI) units.

5. The booklet is partially filled out already. Needs to be highlighted that those data have been used as kind of pilot study and are not valid for as a real pump

6. There are many other information that an inspector may require when participates in a test which are not covered here. For example, for test setup and arrangement, you may refer to base standard for comprehensive pieces of advice and information. I wanted this booklet to be concise and practical. So, it was not possible to include every single concern about pump testing.

7. Finally, feel free to share, review, and comment.
